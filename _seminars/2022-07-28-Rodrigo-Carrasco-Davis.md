title: The Value of Learning with Cognitive Control
seminardate: 28-07-2022
description: Whether a novel task is worth learning, how effort may impact learning, and, consequently, how much effort to allocate towards learning are important questions agents face. Here, we propose a model where a control signal can boost learning speed and improve accuracy while paying a cost when the control is used. The optimal control signal trajectory is computed to maximize the Expected Value of Control (EVC), equivalent to the expected value function, taking the cost of exerting control into account. Changing the task parameters and agent learning capacity shapes the optimal control signal, lending some insights into animal and human behavior when learning a new task. In addition, this control model can be considered as neural modulation, where the control signal acts as a gain modulator changing the transfer function of specific neurons in a neural network, allowing the neural network to surpass its limitations due to its connectivity and learning rules, and potentially give a normative explanation that generates emergent behavior such as attention, multi-tasking, sharing representations, and flow state.
