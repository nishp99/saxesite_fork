Graduate students can join the lab through the [Gatsby Unit PhD Programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/study-and-work/phd-programme) and [SWC PhD Programme](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/content/neuroscience-phd-programme) and should apply directly to these. It is totally fine to apply to both.
