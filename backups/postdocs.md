We currently (14/5/2022) have openings for postdoctoral researchers, research technicians, and a lab manager. We are committed to making our lab open, inclusive and equal and welcome candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, as outlined in our EDI statement.

**The lab has several open postdoctoral positions for theory-driven experimentalists.** We aim to build a lab that blurs the distinction between theory and experiment to sharpen and accelerate the theory-experiment loop. Experiments will focus on rodent systems neuroscience and be undertaken in the Mrsic-Flogel, Hofer, Duan, Erlich, or Akrami labs at SWC; and Behrens, Packer, or Lak labs at Oxford, as appropriate for the question. Contact Andrew in the first instance.

**The lab has one open postdoctoral position in the theory of deep learning.** Full application details to come, contact Andrew in the first instance.
