I am interested in the general principles underlying the function of the cerebral cortex and its interactions with subcortical structures, particularly the thalamus. The cortex is the brain structure considered to be the seat of most of our higher cognitive functions, including conscious perception, motor action, planning, abstract thinking, spatial navigation, language, numeracy, introspection and imagination. Despite the seemingly disparate range of functions attributed to different regions of the cortex, there is a striking similarity in their basic circuit architecture, suggesting the existence of common cortical computations of relevance to all forms of cognition. I am working on developing neural network models that incorporate features from cortico-thalamic circuits in order to understand the type of computational advantages that such architectures could confer to the brain.

I am a Junior Research Fellow at [Merton College](https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-sebastian-vasquez-lopez) and I work between the groups of [Tim Behrens](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/computational-neuroscience-group) and Andrew Saxe.
