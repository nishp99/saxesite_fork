I am a postdoc researcher under [Chris Summerfield](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/christopher-summerfield) and Andrew Saxe. I did my PhD in Experimental Psychology at Oxford, and have mixed background in acoustical engineering, music technology, psychophysics, and cognitive neuroscience. I study the neuro-computational mechanisms of structure learning and inference, using neuroimaging (MEG/fMRI), computational models, and machine intelligence.
