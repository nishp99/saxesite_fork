Can learning in the brain approximate end-to-end learning like gradient descent? How do brain-wide changes cumulate to better task performance? I am tackling these and other questions by investigating the role of midbrain dopamine neurons (and their projections to the striatum) in mice as they learn to perform a visual decision task, from day 1 to expert performance.

My aim is to build a theoretical framework to link the observed behaviour with the measured dopamine release and neural recordings, and then look at possible extensions to the model which can account for continual learning (i.e. learning a second task after training on the first) and the cognitive control of learning (i.e. the decision of whether and how much of our learning abilities to invest in learning a new task).

I am funded by the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics and co-supervised by [Andrew Saxe](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/andrew-saxe) and [Armin Lak](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/armin-lak).
