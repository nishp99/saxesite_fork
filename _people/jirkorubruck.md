I am a student on the GUDTP 1+3 in Experimental Psychology at the university of Oxford co-advised by [Chris summerfield](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/christopher-summerfield) and Andrew Saxe. 

My interests range from Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology to Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning. My MSc work investigates semantic learning. Specifically, I will examine if behavioural and representational changes during the learning of semantic knowledge are analogous to those observed in deep linear networks. To achieve this end, we employ behavioural experiments, neuroimaging, and modelling experiments.
