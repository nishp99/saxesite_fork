How we make choices is a popular subject of interest across psychology and neuroscience, and increasingly machine learning. Most of this work has focused on theories for how to make the best choices at the steady-state, that is, after learning. I am particularly interested in how we _learn_ to make the best choices. 

I am a PhD Candidate at Harvard in David Cox's lab and have been collaborating with Andrew Saxe on this question for some time. We hope to provide you with an (initial) answer to this question soon!
