I am particularly interested in studying the computational neural theories at the basis of learning and memory consolidation in neuronal networks. I am interested in working toward answering questions such as: How does the brain create, store, generalize and update memories without interfering with previously stored memory?  What is the function of episodic memory? I am looking forward to making advances in answering these questions, working at the intersection between theoretical neuroscience research and machine learning.
